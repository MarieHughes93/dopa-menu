Dopa Menu welcome
Sometimes the hardest challenge of having an attention disorder is finding something to stimulate you when you need stimulations.
We can create a dopamine menu or a Dopa-Menu(How to ADHD) for things that excite you. Fill it out now to have 
ready for the next time you are bored. Add to your menu to expand your options. Pause Activities 
because you are not able to do the currently maybe you are just burnt out on it for now) to remove them from random selection.

Select one of the 5 the levels of fulfilment you get:
Appetizer,Entree,Side,Dessert,Special

<p>Appetizer (Things that will give you a quick burst without eating up your time)</p>
<p>Ex: Quick set of jumping jacks. 5 minutes social media check. Stretch outside.)</p>

<p>Entree (Regular day activities that excite you and make you feel alive. </p>
<p>Ex: walking the dog, going to the gym, reading a book)</p>

<p>Side(Things you can do to enhance your experience of that activity.</p>
<p>Ex Listen to music, set a personal challenge:do it while practicing another language, )</p>

<p>Dessert (Thing you tend to over do it on... maybe binge? but you don't feel satisfied from but in large quantities </p>
<p>Ex: Meme's, social media, video games, mindless anything (eating,watching tv, all that while still being bored))</p>
